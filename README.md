# hashManager
hashManager is a Python script designed to manage and monitor your HiveOS mining farm. It provides real-time information about your workers, network hashrate, block rewards, and estimated daily profits. Currently, this script works with the Spectre Network, built specifically for the Spectre Miner, but it also works while using TTN miner.
